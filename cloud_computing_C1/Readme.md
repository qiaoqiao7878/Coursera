# Cloud computing foundations

## Effective technical teamwork
1. Clear, elevating goal
2. Results-driven structure
3. Competent team members
4. Unified commitment
5. Collaborative climate
6. Standards of excellent
7. External support and recognition
8. Principal leadership

## Effective technical project management

- Weekly schedule
- Weekly demo in the company
- DevOps -> continuous delivery -> code is always in deployale state
- Automated testing
- Breaking down tickets, such as Trello -> 3 hours to 4 days
- Builing something that is predictable

## Ticket tracking with Trello

Keep things simple

## Not to do
1. Hero driven development
2. Crisis driven development
3. Highest-paid person's opinion driven development
4. Heavy scrum -> the brighter the process the better
5. Faith in people vs faith in process -> increment result is shown, don't hope something will magically happens

## Continuous Integration (CI)
Software is always in a knowable state.
Automatically test the code when there are some changes at local

Use Github Actions to automatically test the code every time after pushing, set up yaml file.

## Continuous Deployment (CD)

software releases wherein any code commit that passes the automated testing phase is automatically released into the production environment, making changes that are visible to the software's users.

## Cloud Computing Service Models

1. Software as a Service (SaaS)
2. Platform as a Service (PaaS)
3. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
4. Metal as a Service (MaaS)
5. Serverless

## Microservices

## Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

manage infrastructure (networks, virtual machines, load balancers, connection topology) in a descriptive model, an IaC model generates the same environment every time.
We want to reproduce the environments automatically.

Terrafrom: open-source infrastructure as code software tool that enables you to safely and predictably create, change, and improve infrastructure.


## DevOps

### Benefits of DevOps

- speed
- Delivery
- Reliability
- Scale
- Collaboration
- Security

## Continuous Delivery

Automatically test, IaC, Deploy.
The code is always in an improved, and deployable state.
