# Custom and Distributed Training with TensorFlow

• Learn about Tensor objects, the fundamental building blocks of TensorFlow, understand the difference between the eager and graph modes in TensorFlow, 
and learn how to use a TensorFlow tool to calculate gradients.

• Build your own custom training loops using GradientTape and TensorFlow Datasets to gain more flexibility and visibility with your model training. 

• Learn about the benefits of generating code that runs in graph mode, take a peek at what graph code looks like, 
and practice generating this more efficient code automatically with TensorFlow’s tools.

• Harness the power of distributed training to process more data and train larger models, faster, 
get an overview of various distributed training strategies, and practice working with a strategy that trains on multiple GPU cores, and another that trains on multiple TPU cores.
