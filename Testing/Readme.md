# Introduction to software testing

## Test Selection

- Manual testing
- Exception testing
- Boundary testing
- Randomized testing
- Coverage testing
- Requirements testing
- Specification testing
- Safety testing
- Security testing
- Preformance testing

Programmers usually make mistakes at:\
- Boundary conditions
- Complex Boolean Expressions

Thinking like "How can I break this thing"

- Black box testing: examine the requirements
- Write box testing: examine the code

Test cases: test data, expected output

4 parts of a test:

- Set up
- Invocation: execute the software under test
- Assessment: Observing the doftware's behaviour under test, documenting the actions that were taken
- Teardown: such as closing database connections, closing open file handles
